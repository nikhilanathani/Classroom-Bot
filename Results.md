## CSC 510 Project 3

---
Observations from the 2nd lab conducted on 10 participants from CSC 510 Fall 2020.

---
**NOTE**

Given the complexity of the application, we did not ask the lab participants to setup the bot on their local, and instead provided them with a ready setup. To access the ease of setup from a developer's perspective, we instead explained them all the steps involved in setup and asked them to answer survey questions based on their understanding of software development and the information provided during the session.

---
**METHOD USED**

User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

---
**MATERIALS USED**

 - The testing was done over a zoom call. All the details about the setup and the instructions for performing the given tasks were shared during that time.

 - A typeform was provided to the lab rats, to keep track of the time spent on the tasks given to them.

 - The testing was done by creating a VCL instance created by us, and provided the credentials to the participants.
 
 - We compared the results gathered during the testing and created relative graphs using Adobe Spark.

**ANALYSIS & OBSERVATIONS**

Note - Based on the questions asked in the Typeform, the generated visual graphs are as follows. 


> #### *Question: How long did it take for you test the bot (Including the time taken to explain the steps required to setup the bot in lieu of actual setup)*

~~~
The time reported here is in minutes.
As you can see the minimum time reported by the participants for testing the bot is 14 mins, and the maximum time reported by the participants is 30 mins and the average time reported is around 22 mins.
~~~

> #### *Question: Having explained the steps required to setup the bot on your machine, how much time do you expect it would take?*

~~~
The major portion of the time in setting up the bot is consumed in backend service setup which is almost one-fourth of overall time, followed by UI setup and slack service setup which is around 15% and then followed by verification and tools download.
~~~

> #### *Question: How easy is the setup on a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being the easiest and 5 being the hardest?*

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/gI6rkTe.png" />

~~~
Most of the participants felt the setup was relatively moderate, not being too easy and not being too hard, somewhere in between. This might be due to backend service setup which is time consuming task.
~~~

> #### *Question: Did the bot crash during your testing?*

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/L4iy2PZ.png" />

~~~
No crashes were reported during the testing of the product.
~~~

> #### *Question: If the bot was relased for use, with appropriate use case, how likely are you to use this product, 1 being unlikely and 5 being very likely?*

~~~
Majority of the participants were impressed by the product and likely to use the product if released for use with proper usecase.
~~~

> #### *Question: How was your overall experience using the bot on a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being least likely and 5 being most likely. Would you recommend its usage to others?*

~~~
Most of the participants liked the product and were very much willing to recommend it to others.

**CONCLUSIONS**

 - According to the analysis, our bot is agreed to be easily integrated into daily usage and is likely to be used by many. 
 
 - The survey results also indicate that the time taken for setup is randomly distributed with different users.

 - Although some of the lab rats expressed that the setup was complicated in a developer perspective, most of the work is relatively easy due to the docker containerization of both the front end and the back end. The complicated design is also due to the complex use case of the application, which is a major consideration.  

 - It can be observed that the setup environment can be tricky, but the features and the ease of use was given a green light by the majority of the lab rats. 

---
**THREATS TO VALIDITY**

 - Given the limited number of test subjects, the results are not very conclusive. A large number of subjects would need to be surveyed in order to identify the viability of the bot.
 
 - There is a high chance that the reported responses from participants may not have been timed accurately during which the experiment was conducted.
